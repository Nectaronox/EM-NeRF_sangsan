# EM-NeRF_sangsan
EM-NeRF is electrodynamics + NeRF. It's just a prototype.
real_EM_NeRF is the code that I run in rumpod and significantly reduce model's loss.

I write a code with AI model like Claude using coding IDE cursor.
I do not just prompt AI when I write code.
I analyze and understand all the code, also rewriting some code for using it on runpod Jupyter Notebook setting
